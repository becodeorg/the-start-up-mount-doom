# Cremini

### *You don’t need much space to grow mushrooms and for us it doesn’t make sense that they would travel so far to arrive to your table*

### *We grow all of our mushrooms  which we then sell to you for you to enjoy them*

### *Come at Cremini to enjoy the top quality shrooms !*

We do not use any pesticide or fungicides on our lovely mushrooms, for you to enjoy them fully.

Our grow room is accessible for you to visit, from our shop, you can see through a window exactly how we grow them.

**Stop by ! It’s worth having a look !**

And of course, we use eco-conscious packaging for our products!
